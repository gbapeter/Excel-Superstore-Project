# Superstore Sales Analysis
## Introduction
As an aspiring data analyst, I worked on this project to put what I have learned in excel to test and showcase my acquired skills. I set out to uncover insights from a superstore's sales data across three divisions.
## Questions to Analyze
1. What was the best performing city by sales?
2. Which gender spent the most on purchases from the store?
3. Which day had the most sales?
4. Which month had the most sales?
5. At what time did customers patronize the store the most?
6. What was the best selling product line?
7. What was the most used payment method?
8. What is the top rated city?
9. What is the top rated product line?
## Excel Skills Used
- Pivot Tables
- Pivot Charts
- Functions and Formulas
## Superstore Sales Dataset
The dataset used for this project is a superstore sales data from 2019 downloaded from Kaggle.
## Data Cleaning Steps
- I formatted Columns properly including standardizing the date. I also renamed column headers using a proper case.
- I removed columns such as gross margin percentage and gross income because they didn't have distinct values and contained values that were already in another column respectively.
- I created new columns such as Month, Day and Hour using relevant formulas and functions.
## Analysis and Insights
I created a table from which I created relevant pivot tables and pivot charts setting the foundation for subsequent analysis.

- The city of Naypyitaw recorded the highest sales ($105,304) followed by Yangon ($101,143) and lastly Mandalay). Sales in Naypyitaw and Yango were driven mainly by female customers ($58,748 and $50,408 respectively) while those in Mandalay were slightly more driven by male customers ($50,733). Also, based on customer type, sales in all three cities were mainly driven by member customers despite Yango and Mandalay having more normal customers than members. This implies that members spent more money in the stores than normal customers.
- Sports and travel and fashion accessories were the major products sold in Mandalay, there were more male customers (170) than female customers (162) there. Also, there were slightly more normal customers (167) than members (165) there.

- On average,  female customers bought cheaper products ($55.26 unit price) than male customers ($56.08) but bought in more quantities, which resulted in them  spending the most in purchases ($159,889) than men ($147,699).
- The highest amount of sales was recorded on Tuesday ($52,029) followed by Sunday ($47,338), and the least sales were recorded on Monday ($33,380). This could be as a result of work and school schedules on Monday,  spendings during the weekend and people generally having more free time on Sunday.
- The highest amount of sales was recorded in January ($82,441) followed by March ($69,285), and the least sales was recorded in April ($7,579). Notably, a significantly higher revenue was generated in the first quarter of the year. This could be as a result of a general trend in the retail market.
- The highest sales was recorded at 7PM amounting to $37,809 followed by 1PM ($33,070), and the least sales were recorded at 8PM ($21,876). This could be as a result of people shopping after work (a generally observed trend), during lunchtime and people avoiding shopping too close to the store's closing time respectively.

### Product Performance Analysis

- Food and beverages was the top selling product line, having a total of $56,145 in sales. This could be because it is an essential product line. People often prioritize buying basic needs. Food and beverages were followed by sports and travel ($55,123), implying that people in the regions highly engage in recreation and vacationing. Health and beauty was the least selling product line, having a total of $49,194 in sales.
- Fashion accessories had the highest average unit price ($57.15) closely followed by sports and travel ($56.99) while electronic accessories were the cheapest by unit price ($53.55). Product lines with higher unit prices generally had more sales than those with lower unit prices. This implies that higher unit prices did not reduce sales.
Payment Method Analysis
Cash was the most used payment method. This could be as a result of the ease of use and availability.  Ewallet was the second most used payment method and credit card was the least used.
### Customer Satisfaction Analysis
- Naypyitaw was the top rated city with an average rating of 7.07 while Mandalay was the least rated city having an average rating of 6.82. Also, Food and beverages was the top rated product line (7.11), followed by fashion accessories (7.03) while home and lifestyle was the least rated product line, having an average rating of 6.84. This implies that the average rating influenced sales, as product lines and cities with higher average ratings generally performed better than others with lower average ratings. This highlights the importance of having a good service to ensure a great customer experience.
- Food and beverages was the optimal product line, having the highest rating and the highest sales. No direct relationship was observed between rating and total sales.
