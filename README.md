# Superstore Sales Analysis
## Introduction
As an aspiring data analyst, I worked on this project to put what I have learned in excel to test and showcase my acquired skills. I set out to uncover insights from a superstore's sales data across three divisions.
## Questions to Analyze
1. What was the best performing city by sales?
2. Which gender spent the most on purchases from the store?
3. Which day had the most sales?
4. Which month had the most sales?
5. At what time did customers patronize the store the most?
6. What was the best selling product line?
7. What was the most used payment method?
8. What is the top rated city?
9. What is the top rated product line?
## Excel Skills Used
- Pivot Tables
- Pivot Charts
- Functions and Formulas
## Superstore Sales Dataset
The dataset used for this project is a superstore sales data from 2019 downloaded from Kaggle.
## Data Cleaning Steps
- I formatted Columns properly including standardizing the date. I also renamed column headers using a proper case.
- I removed columns such as gross margin percentage and gross income because they didn't have distinct values and contained values that were already in another column respectively.
- I created new columns such as Month, Day and Hour using relevant formulas and functions.
## Analysis and Insights
I created a table from which I created relevant pivot tables and pivot charts setting the foundation for subsequent analysis.
## Key Insights
### Sales Perfomance Analysis
- The city of Naypyitaw recorded the highest sales ($105,304) followed by Yangon ($101,143) and lastly Mandalay). Sales in Naypyitaw and Yango were driven mainly by female customers ($58,748 and $50,408 respectively) while those in Mandalay were slightly more driven by male customers ($50,733). Also, based on customer type, sales in all three cities were mainly driven by member customers despite Yango and Mandalay having more normal customers than members. This implies that members spent more money in the stores than normal customers.
